 <p>Nelson is a well-traveled, entrepreneurial, and analytical  Certified Project Management Professional (PMP)
   who utilizes an interdisciplinary background in engineering, environmental studies, urban planning, construction, 
   and non-profit management to solve complex problems in todayâ€™s fast paced and technologically savvy world.</p>

  <p>I have had the great pleasure to pursue opportunities in engineering, interdisciplinary project management, and 
    international development, with a strong focus on infrastructure including waste management, water / waste water 
    treatment, residential construction, real time metering technology, and electric utilities. This has led me to 
    the Bay Area where I've had the opportunity to act as support staff, construction supervisor, and project manager 
    for a variety of projects.</p>
    
   <p>Currently, I am a professional consultant for T.D. Thornton Group, Inc where I serve as a Project Manager for 
     Pacific Gas & Electric, the largest utility company in California serving approximately 16 million customers, 
     and manage all aspects of the design, construction, and commissioning of electrical substations.</p>
